# Cifar10
<ul>
<li>This includes a simple notebook that contains 2 models for th classification of images on the infamous Cifar-10 dataset.</li>
  <li>The notebook first contains the data analysis which indludes plotting the data, the split, augmentation, normalization, etc.</li>
  <li>After this we have our first model which is <b>VGG19</b> and gives an accuracy of just over <b>80%</b>.</li>
  <li>The next nodel is a custom <b>CNN</b> and also gives an accuracy of around <b>79%</b>.</li>
  <li>The next nodel is <b>ResNet50</b> trained on ImageNet weights and gives an accuracy of around <b>94%</b>.</li>
  <li>After both the models we have their loss and accuracy graphs and also their confusion matrices.</li>
 </ul>
